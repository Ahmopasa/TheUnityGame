# TheUnityGame

* This game was made by watching a video, posted on YouTube, that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8YUfee_pzc). The game is a 2D game and has a top-down perspective. Since I did not make this game all alone, I owe it to myself to thank [Michael](https://www.youtube.com/c/EpitomeGames/about). Also, I would like to thank the creators of the tileset and fonts, which both were used in the game, who can be found [here](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset) and [here](https://www.1001fonts.com/3d-thirteen-pixel-fonts-font.html) respectively.
* This game and the one on the video has some similarities. Because I'd like to use other free-to-use assets in this game.
* This game is still in very early stages, which means that it does not contain many features, such as in-game story, in-game music etc. Because these issues were not mentioned in the video that I watch. Therefore, I will handle these issues myself.
* Since this game is the first game I made, I don't know how efficiently it was designed and how effectively the script codes were written. As a result, this game is currently in the pre-alpha phase.
* Last but not least, this game was build to run on Windows x86_64 architecture.
